# Generic Neural Network

This project intends to create basic individual building blocks to allow the construction of a neural network for binary classification.

Bellow you will find the description for the created files

## sigmoid.py
Here, you will find the implementation of the sigmoid function as well as its derivative

## relu.py
Here, you will find the implementation of the ReLu function as well as its derivative
